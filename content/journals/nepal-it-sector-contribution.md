Today, I feel incredibly proud to learn that Nepal's IT industry has brought over 500 million USD from abroad into the economy in 2022, accounting for a significant 1.4% of the nation's GDP. 

The Institute for Integrated Development Studies (IIDS) recently published a [report](https://iids.org.np/images/publications/428a03a4a6d93ba42521c66c481933ea.pdf) that revealed this insightful data. Every IT professional in the country should take immense pride in this remarkable achievement. Together, we are driving progress and shaping Nepal's bright future, right from each of our office chairs. 

#### Fueling Nepal's Economic Growth:
Amidst the challenges of international trade deficits, the IT industry emerges as a beacon of hope and progress. With this momentous contribution to our economy, Nepal's IT professionals have proven that their skills and high-quality work are valued all over the world. The report by IIDS stands as a testament to the transformative power of technology and innovation, which continues to play a pivotal role in propelling Nepal toward economic prosperity.

#### Empowering the IT Community:
This accomplishment is not just a numerical achievement; it is a celebration of the passion and perseverance of every individual working in Nepal's IT sector. From seasoned experts to fresh talents, each professional has played a crucial role in contributing to this success. This data should ignite a sense of pride in every IT professional, validating their efforts and motivating them to push the boundaries of excellence.

Heartfelt gratitude goes out to the Institute for Integrated Development Studies (IIDS) for their meticulous research and the insightful report that has garnered attention from major news media, shining a spotlight on Nepal's thriving IT industry. I hope it catches the government's attention, prompting them to take affirmative actions in promoting and supporting the thriving IT sector in Nepal.
