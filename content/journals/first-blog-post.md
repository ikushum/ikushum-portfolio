#### My First Code

The journey started when I was learning the basics of HTML. I still remember that day when my first HTML code worked and my name was displayed in the Internet Explorer browser window. Those were the days when the entire class gathered to see one of my classmate’s computer screen when he used the marquee tag to move a piece of text. Those days HTML was just a portion of course in school to pass the exam. But it didn’t take me too long to identify programming as my passion. I used to stay awake till midnights coding in QBASIC. It was then when I decided to make my career in programming.

#### My First App

The first-ever game (in fact the first-ever application) I ever programmed was in QBASIC when I was in 9th grade. It was a simple game where we had to move an asterisk (*) around the screen and score points by moving it over another symbol (I actually forgot what this symbol was). The following year, when I was in 10th grade I programmed another game. It was my first game with colorful graphics. It was more or less like the Mario game where we had to make a moving red ball jump over different hurdles on the way and score points on some occasions. For any normal person, these two applications can just be another boring and crap application but for me, they were the biggest inspirations that led me to put the next step in my programming career.

#### My First Website

My knowledge of HTML was worthless without CSS. After learning to code in HTML and QBASIC, CSS was next. It was an easy hunt. I didn’t take more than a week to learn the basics. Then javascript and jQuery were down within some two or three weeks. For back-end programming, I learned basic PHP and MySQL for working with databases. This took me two more weeks. It was when I started coding my first website (it was technically my second though). Within one month my first ever website was ready to enter the world of the internet. It was a personal website about me and my works.

#### And finally my First blog with Python

After getting to hear a lot about Python and its powerful application, I thought it was time to start learning it. I was totally amazed by the simplicity of python. It was the easiest language I ever coded and nevertheless, its power is amazing. Its application on web development, database, animation, gaming, Desktop GUIs, and even robotics makes it the king of all programming languages(for me at least). Using python and its pygame library I developed my third game. You can download it from my gallery. It was the best application I ever developed. And finally, with python’s Django framework my blog is up and running.

**Edit**: I switched from Django to Ruby on Rails and now this blog is up and running using Rails.  
**Edit 2.0**: I again switched from Rails to Vue/Nuxt and now this blog is up and running using Vue/Nuxt and Nuxt Content.

Congratulation! you made it this far reading my post without falling asleep. I reward you all with a big Thank You. In hope of blogging quite frequently from now on. :)
