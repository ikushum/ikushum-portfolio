Let's start with a simple question. We are given an integer (say n) and asked to find the sum of numbers starting from zero to that number. Let's take a few seconds and come up with a solution in pseudo-code.

Okay! Now that we have a solution, let's look at the following two pseudo-codes.

Code 1:
```
for i = 0 to n
sum = sum + i
end
```

Code 2:
```
sum = n*(n+1)*0.5
```

Most of us possibly came up with a solution pretty similar to the first one consisting of some sort of loop. Well, the code would work perfectly fine for smaller values of n. But what if n was as large as a billion. Imagine how long your code would take to loop through one billion numbers. Pretty slow, eh?

Now let's look at the second approach. This one uses a mathematical formula which I'm sure most of us have come across at least once during High School. Remember that annoying lecture on Arithmetic Series? This formula is used to find the sum of first n natural numbers. Using this approach, we can calculate the sum instantly regardless of the size of n. Smart, eh?

The first approach is called the O(n) complexity approach, clearly, because it has to execute n times. While the second one is the O(1) complexity approach because the execution time is constant regardless of input size.

Being a Computer Scientist or an Engineer, whatever you find pride calling yourself, our job is basically to perform these three operations:

1) Take some input data.  
2) Perform some operation on them.  
3) Display the output data.  

To write the most efficient codes, we need to optimize these steps to their full potential. With a good understanding of Data Structure and Algorithms, optimizing these steps can be a piece of cake. Well, some problems can be optimized using Mathematical Optimization, but for now, let's stick with Data Structure and Algorithms.

Certainly, using an appropriate algorithm we can have our code in good shape. But where do Data Structures come into play?

Data Structure is a way we organize data on the computer. A well-organized data can make a significant pay-off to the performance. Let's take a dictionary as an example. Imagine a situation where we had to search for some randomly distributed words on a dictionary. It would certainly take forever, right? But once the words are arranged alphabetically, all it takes is a matter of seconds.

So how to get started? There are hundreds of free resources out there to learn Data Structure and Algorithms. If I had to suggest one, I would go for tutorials on [Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/). For someone like me, who hates reading lengthy content, watch these lectures from [MIT OpenCourseWare.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb)

If you want to go one step ahead, make a habit of solving coding challenges on sites like [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) on daily basis. Once you make this a habit, you will find an amazing improvement in the approach you take while solving problems, be it in your side project or a job.

Learning a new software development framework might not be the brightest idea after all. Without decent knowledge on Data Structure and Algorithm, learning one framework after another would just help to add counts to something called 'Code Donkeys'.

Even a school kid can start writing applications once he grasps a few syntaxes. What makes someone a computer scientist or an engineer is his ability to write optimized and robust codes. Now it's up to you to decide which category of programmer you want to be.
