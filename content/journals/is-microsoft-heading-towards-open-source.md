Technology is always changing. If we don't keep up with the changes taking place in the tech world, we are gonna get left behind. There were times when the former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer was busy branding Linux "cancer". Back in 2001, when the software giants were at the summit of domination on desktop computing, former Windows chief Jim Allchin famously mentioned, 'Open source is an intellectual-property destroyer'.

With Satya Nadella replacing Ballmer as CEO on 4 February 2014, things have changed. At present, there are several occasions when Microsoft has confessed their love towards open source and Linux. Microsoft is now the top organization with the most open source contributors on Github. It beats Facebook, Docker, Google, Apache, and many other competitors.

It all started when the company launched a Shared Source Initiative and appointed Jason Matusow to oversee the effort. Shared Source allowed individuals and organizations to access certain Microsoft source code for reference and for development in some cases. Furthermore, the software giants open sourced ASP.NET Core which was regarded as a big move.

Recent moves include the open sourcing of PowerShell, Visual Studio Code, and Microsoft Edge's JavaScript engine. Microsoft also partnered with Canonical to bring Ubuntu to Windows 10 and acquired Xamarin to aid mobile app development. Microsoft even open-sourced Xamarin's SDKs and developer tools and launched their cloud service based on Linux.

Microsoft has changed a lot over recent years. However, open sourcing Windows or Office is simply out of question. But their recent involvement on Github and rapidly open sourcing their products clearly raises the question. Considering those days when people compared open-source with 'cancer', we can now evidently say "Open Source has won".
