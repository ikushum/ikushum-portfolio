I am actually writing this post after a week of entering the Sophomore year of college. Looking back into the freshman year, I am pretty proud of my accomplishments but still not satisfied with them. No matter how well I do something, at the end of the day, I always have a feeling that I could have done even better and hence dissatisfaction. But its all-right because the optimists always say:

** Dissatisfaction is always the first step in improvement. **

## Accomplishments from the freshman year

1) **Game Development**: During the early days of my freshman year, I was learning the basics of python, a new programming language for me back then, which turns out to be super amazing. Python was however not the part of our college curriculum unlike C and C++, which were absolutely boooooring. After learning the python basics, I build a simple desktop game using its pygame library. You can check out the source code from [this](https://github.com/ikushum/Ball-Game-2) Github repository.

2) **Web Development**: I had some intermediate knowledge on front-end development before I joined the college. For the back-end development, I started learning Django which is Python's other beautiful framework. After playing around with its features for a couple of weeks, I started building a personal portfolio and blog for my own. The website was originally hosted on Heroku and got pretty good feedback from my friends. In addition, my desire to learn more about JavaScript and jquery ended up building a web version of the game that I originally built with python. I reused most of my python codes and changed them into JavaScript codes. And very recently, I switched from Django to Ruby on Rails. I will be talking about this later down the post.

3) **Started blogging**: I always wanted to start blogging. I think blogging is the best way to share thoughts and knowledge and at the same time gaining them. While I am writing a blog post, I always have like 15 tabs open on my browser, looking for facts and information. On the other hand, it obviously helps improve our writing skills.

4) **First Web Development Internship**: Getting involved in Coding Internships during the freshman year of college is pretty rare. However, I took my first step into the world of Software Development Industry through this internship. I did this internship in a local startup here in Kathmandu, namely Techrise. Techrise provides Ruby on Ruby boot-camp through their online platform and also gives young programmers the opportunity to work on real-life projects which will be used by real clients. The internship proved very effective and working with senior web developers on the same team is a very good experience. This will also definitely be a very strong point for my resume.

With that being said, I am looking forward to make the most out of my sophomore year. I will be learning Java this semester. And let me end this post with the first ever java code I wrote today in class :

```java{}
class Hello {
  public static void main(String args[]){
    for(i=0;i<10;i++){
      System.out.print("Hello " + args[i] );
    }
  }
}
```
