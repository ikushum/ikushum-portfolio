Hello Everyone!

I was thinking of doing a #100DaysOfAlgorithm challenge this month. And then it occurred to me why doing this alone when we have an amazing community of people from all around the world passionate about coding.

Thanks to the Hackathon Hackers Facebook group, now we are a huge community and everyone is highly motivated and pumped up to take the challenge.

The main objective of this challenge is to push ourselves to code every day and develop a quality problem-solving skill.

We will share our progress on Twitter  and Facebook  using the hashtag #100DaysOfAlgorithm. We could post updates on our blogs on a daily or weekly basis. This makes it easy for a community to spring up around it, and for people to find and support one another.

#### Lets get started  

So here's what we will be doing throughout the challenge:

1. First things First, let's create a GitHub repository and name it 100-days-of-Algorithm-Challenge. This is where we will be writing the codes and keep track of our progress.

2. Let's clone the repository to our local machine. Also, make sure it has a README.md file and a directory named as Algorithms.

3. Now that we have the repository locally in our machine, we can start writing some codes. For every algorithm we solve, we create a new file inside the Algorithms directory which will contain the corresponding code for the Algorithm. Of course, the code can be of any language of our choice.

4. Also let's make sure that we give an appropriate name to the file. Also let's name the first file as 1_filename, second as 2_filename, and so on.

5. Once we are done writing the codes, we update the README.md file to track our progress. The format for the README.md file will be :

```md{}[README.md]
# I joined the #100DaysOfAlgorithm Challenge.

##Logs

### Day 0: January 20, 2017
1) **filename1:** description

2) **filename2:** description

### Day 1: January 21, 2017
1) **filename1:** description

2) **filename2:** description
```

6. Now we push the changes to the master branch of our GitHub repository

One last thing and you will officially be the part of the challenge. Fork [this](https://github.com/ikushum/I-Joined-the-100DaysOfAlgorithm-Challenge) repository to your GitHub account and at the bottom of the README.md file, add your name and URL of the main repository you will be working with. Once that's done, just make a pull request which will be verified and merged.

There's no rush. We have an entire 100 days on our hands. Solving one or two problems a day is completely fine. If you have to skip a day for some reason then when you resume, the day that you skipped will not be counted as one of your 100 days. If you are not sure where to find resources to practice Algorithms, take a look at [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms/warmup). There are lots of similar online resources where we can find algorithm problems. Just take some time to Google em.

Hopefully, when we reach the other side of this Challenge we would develop a habit of coding every day. Our GitHub profile would look super active and yes, hiring managers and recruiters do look at these. Moreover, our coding and problem-solving skills would reach the next level.

If you have any questions or suggestions that could help make the challenge more exciting and effective just leave a comment below. I will come back to you as soon as I can. So what are you waiting for, lets kick start the Challenge?
