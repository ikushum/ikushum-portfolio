Writing this post after quite a long time. I had to prepare for my final semester exams for last couple of weeks. Moreover, I started my Internship just before the exams. It was quite a hectic time. However, I coped with it pretty well and my exams went fine.

And yeaaaahh, I got my first web development internship at Techrise. Techrise is a startup based here at Kathmandu which offers bootcamp on Ruby on Rails through their online platform. I took their bootcamp at the end of October and managed to complete it within two weeks and a few days. The bootcamp is supposed to be around seven or eight weeks long. I was one of their fastest graduates. Throughout the time of the bootcamp I build five web apps.

As time went by, Techrise asked me if I could assist them with a project they got from Japan as a Techrise fellow. Now I was in a dilemma. My exams were starting after just a couple of weeks and I had no good preparations yet. On the other hand, I didn't wanted to loose this opportunity to work as a intern on real life project which would be used by real clients. I decided to work on the project.

The project was titled Cancer SNS. Its basically a social networking site where people suffering from cancer interact with each other. It is more or less similar to Facebook. This internship program is really proving very effective. Not everyone gets to work with a team of senior developers on a real life project. Not a single day passes by without learning something useful. This is helping me to further my practical skills and build confidence to become an invaluable developer.
